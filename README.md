# printable-year-calendar

A simple web app to create single-page full-year calendars

## Usage:

This is a single-page web app implemented with Vue.js.

Load the HTML file in a modern web browser. Select the desired year, then click
on the "Hide Controls" button. Pull up the print page dialog, then adjust zoom until
it fits exactly on a full page. You may want to print to PDF to ensure that the 
format ends up exactly as desired, then print the PDF file to a real printer.
